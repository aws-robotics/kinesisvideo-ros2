# kinesis_video_streamer


## Overview
The Kinesis Video Streams ROS package enables robots to stream video to the cloud for analytics, playback, and archival use. Out of the box, the nodes provided make it possible to encode & stream image data (e.g. video feeds and LIDAR scans)
from a ROS “Image” topic to the cloud, enabling you to view the live video feed through the Kinesis Video Console, consume the stream via other applications, or perform intelligent analysis, face detection and face recognition
using Amazon Rekognition.

The node will transmit standard `sensor_msgs::msg::Image` data from ROS topics to Kinesis Video streams, optionally encoding the images as h264 video frames along the way (using the included h264_video_encoder),
and optionally fetches Amazon Rekognition results from corresponding Kinesis Data Streams and publishing them to local ROS topics.

Note: h.264 hardware encoding is supported out of the box for OMX encoders and has been tested to
work on the Raspberry Pi 3. In all other cases, software encoding would be used, which is significantly more computing intensive and may affect overall system performance. If you wish to use a custom ffmpeg/libav encoder, you may
pass a `codec` ROS parameter to the encoder node (the name provided must be discoverable by [avcodec_find_encoder_by_name]). Certain scenarios may require offline caching of video streams which is not yet performed by this node.

**Amazon Kinesis Video Streams**: Amazon Kinesis Video Streams makes it easy to securely stream video from connected
devices to AWS for analytics, machine learning (ML), playback, and other processing. Kinesis Video Streams automatically provisions and elastically scales all the infrastructure needed to ingest streaming video data from millions
of devices. It also durably stores, encrypts, and indexes video data in your streams, and allows you to access your data through easy-to-use APIs. Kinesis Video Streams enables you to playback video for live and on-demand
viewing, and quickly build applications that take advantage of computer vision and video analytics through integration with Amazon Recognition Video, and libraries for ML frameworks such as Apache MxNet, TensorFlow, and OpenCV.

**Amazon Rekognition**: The easy-to-use Rekognition API allows you to automatically identify objects, people, text, scenes, and activities, as well as detect any inappropriate content. Developers can quickly build a searchable
content library to optimize media workflows, enrich recommendation engines by extracting text in images, or integrate secondary authentication into existing applications to enhance end-user security. With a wide variety of use
cases, Amazon Rekognition enables you to easily add the benefits of computer vision to your business.

## Installation

### AWS Credentials
You will need to create an AWS Account and configure the credentials to be able to communicate with AWS services. You may find [AWS Configuration and Credential Files] helpful.

The IAM user will need permissions for the following actions:
- `kinesisvideo:CreateStream`
- `kinesisvideo:TagStream`
- `kinesisvideo:DescribeStream`
- `kinesisvideo:GetDataEndpoint`
- `kinesisvideo:PutMedia`

For [Amazon Rekognition] integration, the user will also need permissions for these actions:
- `kinesis:ListShards`
- `kinesis:GetShardIterator`
- `kinesis:GetRecords`

### Binaries
On Ubuntu you can install the latest version of this package using the following command

        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install -y ros-$ROS_DISTRO-kinesis-video-streamer

### Building from Source

To build from source you'll need to create a new workspace, clone and checkout the latest release branch of this repository, install all the dependencies, and compile. If you need the latest development features you can clone from the `master` branch instead of the latest release branch. While we guarantee the release branches are stable, __the `master` should be considered to have an unstable build__ due to ongoing development. 

- Create a ROS workspace and a source directory

       mkdir -p ~/ros-workspace/src

- Clone the package into the source directory

        cd ~/ros-workspace/src
        git clone https://github.com/aws-robotics/kinesisvideo-ros2.git -b release-latest

- If this package has not been released yet, also fetch unreleased dependencies:

        cd ~/ros-workspace/src/kinesisvideo-ros2
        cp .rosinstall.master .rosinstall
        rosws update

- Install dependencies

        cd ~/ros-workspace && sudo apt-get update
        rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y

- Build the packages

        cd ~/ros-workspace && colcon build

- Configure ROS library path

        source ~/ros-workspace/install/local_setup.bash

- Run the unit tests

        colcon test --packages-select kinesis_video_streamer && colcon test-result --all


## Usage

### Run the node
1. Configure the nodes (for more details, see the extended configuration section below).
  - Set up your AWS credentials and make sure you have the required IAM permissions.
  - Encoding: review [H264 Video Encoder sample configuration file] and pay attention to subscription_topic (camera output - expects a `sensor_msgs::msg::Image` topic) and publication_topic.
  - Streaming: review [Kinesis Video Streamer sample configuration file] - make sure subscription_topic matches the encoder's publication_topic.
2. To use Amazon Rekognition for face detection and face recognition, follow the steps on the Rekognition guide (skip steps 8 & 9 as they are already performed by this node): https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rekognition/latest/dg/recognize-faces-in-a-video-stream.html
3. Run:
  - `ros2 launch kinesis_video_streamer kinesis_video_streamer.launch.py`
4. Example: running on a Raspberry Pi
  - `ros2 run `[`raspicam2`]` raspicam2_node __params:=$(ros2 pkg prefix raspicam2)/share/raspicam2/cfg/params.yaml`
  - `ros2 launch h264_video_encoder h264_video_encoder_launch.py`
  - `ros2 launch kinesis_video_streamer kinesis_video_streamer.launch.py`
  - Log into your AWS Console to see the availabe Kinesis Video stream.
    - For other platforms, replace step 1 with an equivalent command to launch your camera node. Reconfigure the topic names accordingly.

## Configuration File and Parameters
